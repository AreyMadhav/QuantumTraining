# QuantumTraining

Welcome to QuantumTraining! This repository is dedicated to providing resources and materials for learning quantum computing concepts and programming.

## About

Quantum computing is an emerging field that combines principles from physics, mathematics, and computer science to develop powerful computational models. This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for individuals interested in understanding and exploring quantum computing.

## Contents

In this repo you will find the Demo programs that will be given throughout the session, so that you can try them on your own if we ran out of time

## Steps

Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and Rust installed on your system.
   
2. Install PyQuil using pip:

    ```
    pip install pyquil
    ```

3. Verify the installation of Quilc and QVM:

    ```
    quilc --version
    qvm --version
    ```

4. [Run your first PyQuil program](https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/getting_started.html#run-your-first-program) following the instructions provided in the official PyQuil documentation.

5. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/AreyMadhav/QuantumTraining.git`.

6. Explore the contents of the repository, including lecture notes, code examples, and exercises.

7. Install the necessary dependencies for running the code examples. Instructions for installation may vary depending on the quantum computing framework used.
